ShipTracker - VT Explorer Inspired

1️⃣ Run Database.sql on your local SQL Server instance (Desktop, user: sk, password: sk2005).

2️⃣ Prepare a Java/OpenStreetMap Classic map in index.html under C:/PathToYourJavaMap/

3️⃣ Open ShipTracker.sln in Visual Studio, build and run.

When you click a ship on the map, it should activate route details (to be implemented).

You will need to connect C# to SQL and JavaScript via WebBrowser -> ObjectForScripting.
