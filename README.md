# ShipTracker
Tracking vessels

VT Explorer Inspired

VStudio 2019 with .NET Framework 4.7.2

1️⃣ Run Database.sql on your local SQL Server instance (Desktop, user: xx, password: xxxxxx).

2️⃣ Prepare a Java/OpenStreetMap Classic map in index.html under C:/PathToYourJavaMap/

3️⃣ Open ShipTracker.sln in Visual Studio, build and run.

When you click a ship on the map, it should activate route details (to be implemented).

You will need to connect C# to SQL and JavaScript via WebBrowser -> ObjectForScripting.
